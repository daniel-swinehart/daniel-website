            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>My name is Daniel Swinehart. I served in the United States Army from 2005-2010 and the United States Air Force from 2010-2019. I attended the University of Central Oklahoma from 2014-2016 for Computer Science. I completed Programming 1 and 2 courses in C++. I decided to pause my education at the time as I was raising my two young sons and working full-time.</p>
               <br>
            <p>I continued self-study in programming and found your organization back in 2019. At that time the required pre-work requirements included internetingishard.com and javascript.info. I had completed those two online resources and was working on a personal website when my career path changed and I was unable to commit to your training program.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, I am in a great position to pursue my dream of a career in Web Development. Below are two links; one to the Github repository for this website and another for a website I built using HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL to be used as a personal expense tracker.</p>
