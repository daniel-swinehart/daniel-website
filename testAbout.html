               <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p>In 2005, I joined the United States Army as a Heavy Equipment Operator (21E). I was stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and assigned to the 37th Engineering Battalion. In 2006, I deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. After returning, I met and married my wife Victoria in 2009. In June of 2009, I deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Upon return, my original enlistment contract had expired and I decided to look for a more technical career path in the Air Force Reserve.</p>
               <br>
               <p>I enlisted in the Air Force Reserve as an Avionics Technician for communication and navigation systems on heavy aircraft weapon systems in August 2010. From 2011 to 2019, I worked on the KC-10, C-5, and KC-135 airframes. Along the way I cross-trained and became qualified in guidence and control systems </p>
