               <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p>In 2005, I joined the United States Army as a Heavy Equipment Operator (21E). I was stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and assigned to the 37th Engineering Battalion. In 2006, I deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. After returning, I met and married my wife Victoria in April of 2009. In June of 2009, I deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Upon return, my original enlistment contract had expired and I decided to look for a more technical career path in the Air Force Reserve.</p>
               <br>
               <p>In the Air Force Reserve I served as an avionics technician for communication and navigation systems on heavy aircraft from 2010 to 2019. During that time I became an Air Reserve Technician (ART), working full-time for my assigned unit and gained experience on KC-10, C-5, and KC-135 airframes. Along the way I cross-trained and became qualified in guidence and control systems and advanced to the rank of E-6.</p>
               <br>
               <p>In December of 2016, I remained a traditional reservist with my unit but took full-time employment with the Federal Aviation Addministration (FAA). As a technician with the FAA, I performed depot level repair on National Air Space (NAS) equipment. This included Air Surveillance Radar (ASR), Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR), communication, weather, and airfield lighting systems.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Our family's chance to follow our dream of living abroad came in 2019. I took a position with a business consulting firm that allowed me to work 100% remotely. We chose Morocco after having visited for vacation. My wife and I had always wanted to return and raise our family in a rich and diverse culture. It's climate, terrain, people, and close proximity to Europe make it a beautiful home.</p>
